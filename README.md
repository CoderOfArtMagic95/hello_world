Introducing myself out to the coding community

I'm CoderOfArtMagic95, I'm an artist who is learning to code to be able to do some Web Development and Software Development. I know a few languages so far. These languages are C#, Java, a bit of SQL, a bit of HTML, a bit of CSS, some C++ , and some Assembly Language. I feel like I have more experience in C# and Java, though... If I am coding and there's a simpler way to make a line of code work the same way or if there's an error within my code, please let me know. I would really aprreciate it!
